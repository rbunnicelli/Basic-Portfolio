            <p1>My name is Richard Bunnicelli but, everybody calls me Ricky. I am a Staten Island native and attended Susan E. Wagner High School where I played baseball for four years. Upon graduation, I attended the University at Albany (Go Great Danes!). I received my Bachelor's degree in Business with a focus in Information Technology Management. For the past three and a half years I have been working for Governor Andrew M. Cuomo in the NYC office located in midtown Manhattan. I am the Assistant Director of Administrative Services for the NYC office. In addition, I handle all IT issues on a day to day basis. I am looking to learn full stack development and do this full time in the near future! </p1>
